# Project requirements

Build a search interface using Algolia. It can be for mobile or the web. You can integrate it into an existing website or app, or create a simple, standalone interface for the contest.

In you are not familiar with Algolia, we suggest you follow our [Quick Start guide](https://www.algolia.com/doc/guides/getting-started/quick-start/), which will help you (a) send data to Algolia and (b) build a UI. You can also use our [Interactive Tutorial](https://www.algolia.com/doc/onboarding/#/pick-dataset) for the same purposes.

Additionally, feel free to use any of Algolia’s features: facets, solutions, paging, menus, and so on. Check out our [solutions page](https://www.algolia.com/doc/guides/solutions/gallery-overview/) in the docs for tutorials, and check our [inspiration library](https://www.algolia.com/search-inspiration-library/) to see what you can build. 

We will not accept projects that display violence, pornography, abuse, or any kind of hate speech, as stated in the Coding Contest [Official Rules](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1tO_zOR_noyTxfkpB18gI6MNmcSu9TWRs/view?usp=sharing).



# Criteria

To evaluate your submitted project, we will take into account:
- **Functionality:** Is your code clean, does it work well?
- **User experience:** Once you've got the features, now it’s time to design the interface. Are features well placed on the screen? Are they nicely styled? Extra points for creativity or novelty!

# Your project - Pick one:

**Important note**: you can only submit _one_ project. 

Choose from one of the following three categories:


## First category 

**Build a project using both the [Strapi](https://strapi.io/) and [Algolia](https://www.algolia.com/) APIs.**
You can also include any other APIs or tool you'd like for this project.


## Second category

If you're not familiar with Strapi, we offer you a broader option: **build a project using the Algolia API**.
You can also include any other APIs or tools you'd like for this project. Please refer to our [documentation](https://www.algolia.com/doc) if you have any questions.


## Third category

**Build an Algolia implementation using a pre-made Codesandbox**.
